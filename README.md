# CODENAME_PANCAKE
Repo for our awesome and totally fun game.

In this game, you bounce objects and enemies with a tennis racket away from Earth to prevent apocalyptic destruction.

The Earth is in imminent danger. Countless asteroids, bombs, and evil alien invaders are trying to destroy the planet and end all life as we know it. It is your job as Earth’s final line of defense with a giant Tennis racket to bounce away all of the objects and invaders to keep Earth’s health from dropping to zero. 
In the first 2 minutes, you are presented with the Earth at the bottom of the screen and its health bar. It tells you that you can move the tennis racket that is above the earth with the left and right arrow keys or the a and d keys. The first enemy type will come toward the earth and you move the racket under the enemies to bounce them away. After about 1 minute of bouncing things away from Earth, you are presented with an upgrade screen and can purchase an upgrade or powerup. The game progressively becomes harder with faster enemies that can move in complex patterns. The game ends when the health of the Earth reaches zero.

The game is a simple flash type game with very simple controls. It is in a cartoonish style and takes place in space. It is a roguelike survival game where you just go as long as you can to get the highest score possible.
